# Project Report: Learning Style Classifier

## Objective
To classify students into learning styles (Visual, Textual, Practice-based) based on quiz interaction data using a machine learning model.

## Dataset
- Simulated data of 300 students.
- Features include time spent on videos, reading, practice problems, quizzes attempted, and average quiz score.

## Methodology
- Labeled learning styles based on dominant time allocation.
- Trained a Random Forest classifier using scikit-learn.
- Deployed using Streamlit for interactive predictions.

## Outcome
- Achieved a functional prototype with high accuracy on simulated data.
- App allows real-time input and visualization.

## Future Work
- Train on real-world data.
- Add explainability features (e.g., SHAP).
- Integrate student profiles and history tracking.
